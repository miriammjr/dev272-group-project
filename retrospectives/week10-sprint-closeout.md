Bugs or blockers

- We had some issues getting testing to work, but were able to figure it out.
- We weren't able to figure out how to see coverage, so we're relying on guessing.

Key wins and challenges

- Shop screen was created and is functional.
- Camera was successfully integrated into the app for the shop screen.
