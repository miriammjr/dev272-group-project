** Key wins and challenges **

- Made and presented the final presentation
- App is functional and does what we set out to do
- Because one screen is camera-dependent, we weren't able to test it as much as we'd like. However, it seems to be functional.
- When trying to commit this file to the repository, a test failed despite not having changed anything.
