### Unfinished tasks (with notes)
Login/registration and testing (Miriam) - due to issues with running the app, these branches were unable to be merged with the rest of the project.

### Bugs or blockers
Main was in an undesirable condition, which led to confusion.
Due to the env file, there was a security issue, which was difficult to fix.

### Key wins and challenges
There was an issue with the main branch, due to a poor merge. Because of that, we were able to come up with a new plan on how to organise branches going forward.

### Next sprint priorities
Testing
Getting the login/registration components working
Same structured project for group members
