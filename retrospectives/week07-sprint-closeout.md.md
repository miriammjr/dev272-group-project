**Completed tasks**

- User database (Milton)
- TaskCard component (Milton)
- Tasks list (Milton)
- Navigation tabs (Jonathan)
- Task and supply screen (Jonathan)
- Calendar (Jonathan)

**Unfinished tasks**

- Login and registration (Miriam) - health problems, did not complete. Priority for next week.

**Bugs or blockers**

- One team member dropped the class towards the end of the week. While he wasn't formally assigned to any task, this gives us less of a buffer for future tasks and weeks.
- One team member was hospitalized and did not get the assigned task done due to health issues.

**Key wins and challenges**

- Because tasks were split up, team members were able to complete things independently without needing to wait for others to finish their parts for the most part. 
- However, due to this, it is hard to merge branches, both due to a lack of communication and due to merge conflicts. 

**Next sprint priorities**

- Finish the login and registration page
- Daily to-do list
- Shopping and ordering screen
- Database and task-list hook/context
- Navigation testing
- UI context wrapper
