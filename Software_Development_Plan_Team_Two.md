Project Overview

This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept mobile application using React Native and Expo. The goal is to demonstrate key functionality, technical feasibility, and user experience for a targeted use case.

Resupply is a mobile application designed to streamline household management by tracking both supply consumption and chore completion cycles. The app monitors usage rates of household supplies, calculates average consumption periods, and generates timely reminders for replenishment. Additionally, it tracks recurring household chores, estimates optimal completion intervals based on past patterns, and provides smart scheduling suggestions to maintain a well-organized home. With an intuitive interface and insightful analytics, Resupply helps users optimize their routines, reduce waste, and stay on top of essential tasks effortlessly.

Objectives

Develop a mobile app with core features to solve a specific problem or fulfill a user need.
