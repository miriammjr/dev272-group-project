### Week 2

- Supplies and chores can be added.
- Calendar and settings page are visible.

To run, these installations need to occur:

npm i @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

npm i expo-notifications

npm i react-native-calendars

npm i @react-native-community/datetimepicker

I am having trouble merging the week 1 branch into this branch; will try to resolve it.
