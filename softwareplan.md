# App ideas

## Option 1: essentials tracking system

Navigation: tab system
Screens: Chore list, food list, cleaning supplies, calendar
Forms: food, cleaning supplies
Data storage: anything currently used is stored locally, anything else stored remotely.
(every new bottle of something stored in a new row in the table? unsure)
Data fetching: only for searching names of previously used things. don't think it's necessary for much else

### Problem that will be solved

For people with memory problems or other executive functioning issues, remembering to do chores or to buy new supplies or food when needed is difficult.
This app will help keep track of all of that.

### Target Users

This will target people who have executive functioning issues primarily, although many others will be able to benefit from it.

### MVP features

Notifications, ability to track when things are used up (or predict)

### Planned Tech Stack

Supabase?

## Option 2: music practice tracking system
Navigation: tab system
Screens: Music piece list, practice tracker, planner, click on piece to access different sections of music and notes
Forms: piece in general (composer, etc), notes (sections of music [i.e., measure numbers]), practice addition
Perhaps some sort of (tiny) algorithm to be able to make goals for deadlines (i.e. lessons, rehearsals, performances)
Data storage: current pieces remotely, past should be stored remotely
Data fetching: when necessary, fetch data from past pieces.

### Problem that will be solved

While classical musicians need to keep track of their music practicing, there aren't many tech solutions for that and most use paper and pen.
It would be nice to have it on their phones.

### Target Users

This will target primarily classical musicians.

### MVP Features

Tracking features

### Planned Tech Stack

Supabase
