# App ideas

Option 1: essentials tracking system
Navigation: tab system
Screens: Chore list, food list, cleaning supplies, calendar
Forms: food, cleaning supplies
Data storage: anything currently used is stored locally, anything else stored remotely.
(every new bottle of something stored in a new row in the table? unsure)
Data fetching: only for searching names of previously used things. don't think it's necessary for much else

Option 2: music practice tracking system
Navigation: tab system
Screens: Music piece list, practice tracker, planner, click on piece to access different sections of music and notes
Forms: piece in general (composer, etc), notes (sections of music [i.e., measure numbers]), practice addition
Perhaps some sort of (tiny) algorithm to be able to make goals for deadlines (i.e. lessons, rehearsals, performances)
Data storage: current pieces remotely, past should be stored remotely
Data fetching: when necessary, fetch data from past pieces.
